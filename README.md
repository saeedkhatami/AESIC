# AES in C

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/AES_%28Rijndael%29_Round_Function.png)

This is a very simple (and **NOT a highly optimized and secure**) implementation of AES only written to teach you the **BASICS** of this algorithm.

Advanced Encryption Standard

AES is based on a design principle known as a [substitution–permutation network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network "Substitution–permutation network"), and is efficient in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a [Feistel network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_network "Feistel network"). AES is a variant of Rijndael, with a fixed [block size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_size_(cryptography) "Block size (cryptography)") of 128 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit"), and a [key size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size "Key size") of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, Rijndael _per se_ is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits. Most AES calculations are done in a particular [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic "Finite field arithmetic").

AES operates on a 4 × 4 [column-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-major_order "Column-major order") array of 16 bytes $b_0, b_1, ..., b_15$ termed the _state_:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & b_4 & b_8 & b_{12} \\
b_1 & b_5 & b_9 & b_{13} \\
b_2 & b_6 & b_{10} & b_{14} \\
b_3 & b_7 & b_{11} & b_{15}
\end{bmatrix}$$

The key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext"), into the final output, called the [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext"). The number of rounds are as follows:

*   10 rounds for 128-bit keys.
*   12 rounds for 192-bit keys.
*   14 rounds for 256-bit keys.

Each round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key itself. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.

### High-level description of the algorithm

1. KeyExpansion – round keys are derived from the cipher key using the [AES key schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_key_schedule "AES key schedule"). AES requires a separate 128-bit round key block for each round plus one more.
2. Initial round key addition:
    1.   AddRoundKey – each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round key using [bitwise xor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_xor "Bitwise xor").
3. 9, 11 or 13 rounds:
    1. SubBytes – a [non-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [lookup table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box "Rijndael S-box").
    2. ShiftRows – a transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.
    3. MixColumns – a linear mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
    4. AddRoundKey
4. Final round (making 10, 12 or 14 rounds in total):
    1. SubBytes
    2. ShiftRows
    3. AddRoundKey

### The SubBytes step

[Rijndael S-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box "Rijndael S-box")

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/AES-SubBytes.svg)

In the  SubBytes step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, _S_; _bij_ = _S(aij)_.

---

In the  SubBytes step, each byte a ${i,j}$ in the _state_ array is replaced with a  SubByte $S(a\_{i,j})$ using an 8-bit [substitution box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_box "Substitution box"). Before round 0, the _state_ array is simply the plaintext/input. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher "Cipher"). The S-box used is derived from the [multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") over [GF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field")$(2^8)$, known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation"). The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [derangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement "Derangement")), i.e., $S(a\_{i,j})\neq a\_{i,j}$ , and also any opposite fixed points, i.e., $S(a\_{i,j})\oplus a\_{i,j}\neq {\text{FF}}\_{16}$. While performing the decryption, the  InvSubBytes step (the inverse of  SubBytes) is used, which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse.

### The ShiftRows step

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/AES-ShiftRows.svg)

In the  ShiftRows step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left. The number of places each byte is shifted differs incrementally for each row.

---

The  ShiftRows step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain [offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_(computer_science) "Offset (computer science)"). For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively.[\[note 6\]](#cite_note-17) In this way, each column of the output state of the  ShiftRows step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. The importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES would degenerate into four independent block ciphers.

### The MixColumns step

[Rijndael MixColumns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns "Rijndael MixColumns")

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/AES-MixColumns.svg)

In the  MixColumns step, each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial $c(x)$

---

In the  MixColumns step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation "Linear transformation"). The  MixColumns function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with  ShiftRows,  MixColumns provides [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_(cryptography) "Diffusion (cryptography)") in the cipher.

During this operation, each column is transformed using a fixed matrix (matrix left-multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state):

$$\begin{bmatrix}
b_{0,j} \\
b_{1,j} \\
b_{2,j} \\
b_{3,j}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{0,j} \\
a_{1,j} \\
a_{2,j} \\
a_{3,j}
\end{bmatrix}
\quad 0 \leq j \leq 3
$$

Matrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries. Entries are bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order $x^{7}$. Addition is simply XOR. Multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial $x^{8}+x^{4}+x^{3}+x+1$. If processed bit by bit, then, after shifting, a conditional [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or") with 1B16 should be performed if the shifted value is larger than FF16 (overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial). These are special cases of the usual multiplication in ${GF}(2^{8})$.

In more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over ${GF}(2^{8})$ and is then multiplied modulo ${01}_{16}\cdot z^{4}+{01}_{16}$ with a fixed polynomial $c(z)={03}_{16}\cdot z^{3}+{01}_{16}\cdot z^{2}+{01}_{16}\cdot z+{02}_{16}$. The coefficients are displayed in their [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from ${GF}(2)[x]$. The  MixColumns step can also be viewed as a multiplication by the shown particular [MDS matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDS_matrix "MDS matrix") in the [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field") ${GF}(2^{8})$ . This process is described further in the article [Rijndael MixColumns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns "Rijndael MixColumns").

### The  AddRoundKey

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/AES-AddRoundKey.svg)

In the  AddRoundKey step, each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round subkey using the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or") operation (⊕).

---

In the  AddRoundKey step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography) "Key (cryptography)") using [Rijndael's key schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_key_schedule "Rijndael key schedule"); each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or").
